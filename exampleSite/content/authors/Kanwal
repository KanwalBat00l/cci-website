bio: 
A dignified professional having an extensive experience in academia, industry, research & development is now ready for the roller coaster ride of pursuing a Doctorate degree. I started working as a PhD candidate in the Complex Cyber Infrastructures (CCI) Research group which positions itself primarily in the Systems & Networking (SNE) and Data Science of the Informatics Institute at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). I really am so grateful to have Zoltán Ádám Mann and Paola Grosso as wonderful mentors to work with. They facilitate in mapping my PhD journey, advising on a research topic, connecting me with the resources I need, being available and responding to my emails and questions. My research expertise and accomplishments spanned the gamut of security and privacy problems.
The first job entailed working with the teams of developers to design web apps with varying functionalities from systems to analysis & search algorithms and develop malware detection. I spent the better part of my career in TU Delft as well as Capital University of Science & Technology (CUST), Islamabad, Pakistan and in the Secure Systems and Network Engineering (SNE) MS Program at the Innopolis University (IU), Russia. SNE was originally brought to the IU from the SNE of University of Amsterdam (UvA). The main taught MS courses were Security of Systems & Networks, Advanced Security, Offensive Technologies and Essential Research writing Skills. The notable B.E./B.S. Undergraduate taught courses were Discrete Mathematics, Databases, Wireless Networks & Communications and Computer Architecture etc. The main responsibilities included preparing & designing the course material, lecturing tutorials, conducting practical labs, creating & assessing assignments as well as grading exams & mentoring TA Heads & TAs; group projects and students writing their bachelor thesis, supervising B.S. Final Year Projects (FYP), M.S. Research Projects & Summer internships.
Being an active learner, I completed certain security certifications and stay in touch with the latest security and technological news, analysis, research, innovations and events worldwide. Amongst the achievements, I received the Outstanding Researcher Recommendation from Russia. Moreover, I was appreciated as an Instructor or Trainer for Competitions/ Challenge preparation, attended various international or national workshops, organized guest lectures and remained an active event coordinator for Open houses, farewells, sports, quiz or debated competitions.
